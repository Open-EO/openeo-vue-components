A merge operation without overlap should be reversible with (a set of) filter operations for each of the two cubes. The process performs the join on overlapping dimensions, with the same name and type.\\n\\nAn overlapping dimension has the same name, type, reference system and resolution in both dimensions, but can have different labels. One of the dimensions can have different labels, for all other dimensions the labels must be equal. If data overlaps, the parameter `overlap_resolver` must be specified to resolve the overlap.\\n\\n**Examples for merging two data cubes:**\\n\\n1. Data cubes with the dimensions (`x`, `y`, `t`, `bands`) have the same dimension labels in `x`, `y` and `t`, but the labels for the dimension `bands` are `B1` and `B2` for the first cube and `B3` and `B4`. An overlap resolver is *not needed*. The merged data cube has the dimensions `x`, `y`, `t` and `bands` and the dimension `bands` has four dimension labels: `B1`, `B2`, `B3`, `B4`.\\n2. Data cubes with the dimensions (`x`, `y`, `t`, `bands`) have the same dimension labels in `x`, `y` and `t`, but the labels for the dimension `bands` are `B1` and `B2` for the first data cube and `B2` and `B3` for the second. An overlap resolver is *required* to resolve overlap in band `B2`. The merged data cube has the dimensions `x`, `y`, `t` and `bands` and the dimension `bands` has three dimension labels: `B1`, `B2`, `B3`.\\n3. Data cubes with the dimensions (`x`, `y`, `t`) have the same dimension labels in `x`, `y` and `t`. There are two options:\\n   1. Keep the overlapping values separately in the merged data cube: An overlap resolver is *not needed*, but for each data cube you need to add a new dimension using ``add_dimension()``. The new dimensions must be equal, except that the labels for the new dimensions must differ by name. The merged data cube has the same dimensions and labels as the original data cubes, plus the dimension added with ``add_dimension()``, which has the two dimension labels after the merge.\\n   2. Combine the overlapping values into a single value: An overlap resolver is *required* to resolve the overlap for all pixels. The merged data cube has the same dimensions and labels as the original data cubes, but all pixel values have been processed by the overlap resolver.\\n4. A data cube with dimensions (`x`, `y`, `t` / `bands`) or (`x`, `y`, `t`, `bands`) and another data cube with dimensions (`x`, `y`) have the same dimension labels in `x` and `y`. Merging them will join dimensions `x` and `y`, so the lower dimension cube is merged with each time step and band available in the higher dimensional cube. This can for instance be used to apply a digital elevation model to a spatio-temporal data cube. An overlap resolver is *required* to resolve the overlap for all pixels.\\n\\nAfter the merge, the dimensions with a natural/inherent label order (with a reference system this is each spatial and temporal dimensions) still have all dimension labels sorted. For other dimensions where there is no inherent order, including bands, the dimension labels keep the order in which they are present in the original data cubes and the dimension labels of `cube2` are appended to the dimension labels of `cube1`.","categories":["cubes"],"parameters":[{"name":"cube1","description":"The first data cube.","schema":{"type":"object","subtype":"raster-cube"}},{"name":"cube2","description":"The second data cube.","schema":{"type":"object","subtype":"raster-cube"}},{"name":"overlap_resolver","description":"A reduction operator that resolves the conflict if the data overlaps.

The dataset was derived from the 1 second smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S; ANZCW0703014016) by enforcing hydrological connectivity with the ANUDEM software, using selected AusHydro V1.6 (February 2010) 1:250,000 scale watercourse lines (ANZCW0503900101) and lines derived from DEM-S to define the watercourses. The drainage enforcement has produced a consistent representation of hydrological connectivity with some elevation artefacts resulting from the drainage enforcement. A full description of the methods is in preparation (Dowling et al., in prep).\\n\\nThis product provides a DEM suitable for use in hydrological analysis such as catchment definition and flow routing.","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Geoscience Australia","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"http://www.ga.gov.au/metadata-gateway/metadata/record/72759/"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/AU_GA_DEM_1SEC_v10_DEM-H"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[112.99,-44.06,154,-9.99]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2010-02-01T00:00:00Z","2010-02-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/AU/GA/DEM_1SEC/v10/DEM-H"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/DEMH_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/AU_GA_DEM_1SEC_v10_DEM-H#terms-of-use"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0-beta.2","stac_extensions":[],"id":"AU/GA/DEM_1SEC/v10/DEM-S","title":"DEM-S: Australian Smoothed Digital Elevation Model","description":"The Smoothed Digital Elevation Model (DEM-S) was derived from the SRTM data acquired by NASA in February 2000.

Non-Methane Volatile\\nOrganic Compounds (NMVOCs) are, together with NO<sub>x</sub>, CO and CH<sub>4</sub>, among the\\nmost important precursors of tropospheric O<sub>3</sub>. The major HCHO source in the remote\\natmosphere is CH<sub>4</sub> oxidation. Over the continents, the oxidation of higher NMVOCs\\nemitted from vegetation, fires, traffic and industrial sources results in important\\nand localized enhancements of the HCHO levels.

All data\\nare standardized over a common time period of 1981-2016.\\n\\nPDSI and Z are calculated using a modified version of the Palmer formula which\\nuses reference evapotranspiration and precipitation from GRIDMET, and a static\\nsoil water holding capacity layer (top 1500mm) from STATSGO. Modifications to\\nthe coefficients of the original Palmer formula are applied to calculate PDSI.\\nThe baseline period for PDSI and Z calculations is 1979-2018.\\n\\nInterpretation of the drought indices in this dataset is different for PDSI and\\nZ than for SPI, SPEI and EDDI. Utilizing the interpretation from the US Drought\\nmonitor, values of these drought indices have the following meaning:\\n\\nPDSI and z:\\n\\n  * 5.0 or more (extremely wet)\\n  * 4.0 to 4.99 (very wet)\\n  * 3.0 to 3.99 (moderately wet),\\n  * 2.0 to 2.99 (slightly wet)\\n  * 1.0 to 1.99 (incipient wet spell)\\n  * -0.99 to 0.99(near normal)\\n  * -1.99 to -1.00 (incipient dry spell)\\n  * -2.99 to -2.00 (mild drought)\\n  * -3.99 to -3.00 (moderate drought)\\n  * -4.99 to -4.00 (severe drought)\\n  * -5.0 or less (extreme drought)\\n\\nSPI/SPEI/EDDI:\\n\\n  * 2.0 or more (extremely wet)\\n  * 1.6 to 1.99 (very wet)\\n  * 1.3 to 1.59 (moderately wet),\\n  * 0.8 to 1.29 (slightly wet)\\n  * 0.5 to 0.79 (incipient wet spell)\\n  * -0.49 to 0.49(near normal),\\n  * -0.79 to -0.5 (incipient dry spell)\\n  * -1.29 to -0.8 (mild drought)\\n  * -1.59 to -1.3 (moderate drought)\\n  * -1.99 to -1.6 (severe drought)\\n  * -2.0 or less (extreme drought).\\n\\nThis dataset contains provisional products that are replaced with\\nupdated versions when the complete source data become available.\\nProducts can be distinguished by the value of the \'status\' property.\\nAt first, assets are ingested with status=\'early\'.

The DEGURBA discriminates the\\npopulation grid cells in three main classes: \'[urban centers](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)\'\\n(cities), \'[urban clusters](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_cluster)\'\\n(towns and suburbs), and \'[rural grid cells](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Rural_grid_cell)\'.\\n(base). These class abstractions translate to \'high density clusters (HDC)\',\\n\'low density clusters (LDC)\', and \'rural grid cells (RUR)\', respectively,\\nin the GHS-SMOD implementation.\\n\\nThe \'HDC\' differ from the DEGURBA \'[urban centers](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)\'\\nin that they account for the over-fragmentation of cities in regions\\nwith large low-density residential development by integrating the\\nbuilt-up layer. In the GHS-SMOD representation, the \'HDC\' are the spatial\\ngeneralization of contiguous population grid cells (4-connectivity,\\ngap-filling) with a density of at least 1500 inhabitants per km² or a\\ndensity of built-up surface > 50%, and a minimum total resident population\\nof 50000. The \'LDC\' are continuous grid cells with a density of at least 300\\ninhabitants per km² and a minimum total population of 5000. The \'RUR\' are\\ngrid cells outside \'HDC\' and \'LDC\' with population > 0 and < 300. Everything\\nelse is classified as inhabited areas where population = 0.\\n\\nThis dataset was produced in the World Mollweide projection (EPSG:54009).\\n\\nFor more information visit: [http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php](http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/ghs_smod.php).\\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"EC JRC","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"http://ghsl.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GHSL_P2016_SMOD_POP_GLOBE_V1"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1975-01-01T00:00:00Z","2015-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/JRC/GHSL/P2016/SMOD_POP_GLOBE_V1"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/GHSL_SMOD_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JRC_GHSL_P2016_SMOD_POP_GLOBE_V1#terms-of-use"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0-beta.2","stac_extensions":[],"id":"JRC/GSW1_2/GlobalSurfaceWater","title":"JRC Global Surface Water Mapping Layers, v1.2","description":"This dataset contains maps of the location and temporal\\ndistribution of surface water from 1984 to 2019 and provides\\nstatistics on the extent and change of those water surfaces.\\nFor more information see the associated journal article: [High-resolution\\nmapping of global surface water and its long-term changes](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7633/full/nature20584.html)\\n(Nature, 2016) and the online [Data Users Guide](https://storage.googleapis.com/global-surface-water/downloads_ancillary/DataUsersGuidev2.pdf).\\n\\nThese data were generated using 4,185,439 scenes from Landsat\\n5, 7, and 8 acquired between 16 March 1984 and 31 December 2019.\\nEach pixel was individually classified into water / non-water\\nusing an expert system and the results were collated into a monthly\\nhistory for the entire time period and two epochs (1984-1999,\\n2000-2019) for change detection.\\n\\n\\nThis mapping layers product consists of 1 image containing 7 bands.\\nIt maps different facets of the spatial and temporal distribution of\\nsurface water over the last 35 years.
