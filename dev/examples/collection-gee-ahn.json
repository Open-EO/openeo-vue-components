It was generated from LIDAR data taken in the spring between 2007 and 2012.\n\nIt contains ground level samples with all other items above ground (such as buildings, bridges, trees etc.) removed. This version is interpolated; the areas where objects have been removed are filled with interpolated values. The point cloud was converted to a 0.5m grid using a squared inverse distance weighting method.\nNote: This dataset does not include a small number of tiles listed in the manifest that are only available at a lower resolution.","license":"proprietary","links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/AHN/AHN2_05M_INT"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/AHN_AHN2_05M_INT_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/AHN_AHN2_05M_INT#terms-of-use"}],"keywords":["ahn","dem","elevation","geophysical","lidar","netherlands"],"providers":[{"name":"AHN","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"http://www.ahn.nl/index.html"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/AHN_AHN2_05M_INT"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[3.35,50.74,7.24,53.55]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","2012-01-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"summaries":{"gsd":[0.5],"eo:bands":[{"name":"elevation","description":"Elevation","gee:unit":"Meters"}],"gee:terms_of_use":["The datasets of the AHN are available as Open Data.
