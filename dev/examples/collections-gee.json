It is planned\nto provide yearly updates from 2020 through the use of a Sentinel time-series.\n\nSee also:\n\n* [Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3938968)\n\n* [Product User Manual](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3938963)\n\n* [Validation Report](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3938974)\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Copernicus","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"https://land.copernicus.eu/global/lcviewer"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","2019-12-31T23:59:59Z"]]}},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/COPERNICUS/Landcover/100m/Proba-V-C3/Global"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V_Global_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/COPERNICUS_Landcover_100m_Proba-V-C3_Global#terms-of-use"},{"rel":"source","href":"https://lcviewer.vito.be/download"},{"rel":"cite-as","href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3939038"},{"rel":"cite-as","href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3518026"},{"rel":"cite-as","href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3518036"},{"rel":"cite-as","href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3518038"},{"rel":"cite-as","href":"https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3939050"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0-beta.2","stac_extensions":[],"id":"COPERNICUS/S1_GRD","keywords":["Copernicus", "SAR", "ESA"],"title":"Sentinel-1 SAR GRD: C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar Ground Range Detected, log scaling","description":"The Sentinel-1 mission provides data from a dual-polarization\nC-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) instrument.

It plays a role in chemistry on a local and global\nscale and its impact ranges from short-term pollution to effects on climate.\nOnly about 30% of the emitted SO<sub>2</sub> comes from natural sources; the majority\nis of anthropogenic origin. SO<sub>2</sub> emissions adversely affect human health and\nair quality. SO<sub>2</sub> has an effect on climate through radiative forcing, via\nthe formation of sulphate aerosols. Volcanic SO<sub>2</sub> emissions can also pose a\nthreat to aviation, along with volcanic ash. S5P/TROPOMI samples the Earth’s\nsurface with a revisit time of one day with unprecedented spatial resolution\nof 3.5 x 7 km which allows the resolution of fine details including the\ndetection of much smaller SO<sub>2</sub> plumes. [[More information](http://www.tropomi.eu/data-products/sulphur-dioxide)]\n\nFor this L3 SO<sub>2</sub> product, the absorbing_aerosol_index is calculated with a\npair of measurements at the 340 nm and 380 wavelengths.

All data\nare standardized over a common time period of 1981-2016.\n\nPDSI and Z are calculated using a modified version of the Palmer formula which\nuses reference evapotranspiration and precipitation from GRIDMET, and a static\nsoil water holding capacity layer (top 1500mm) from STATSGO. Modifications to\nthe coefficients of the original Palmer formula are applied to calculate PDSI.\nThe baseline period for PDSI and Z calculations is 1979-2018.\n\nInterpretation of the drought indices in this dataset is different for PDSI and\nZ than for SPI, SPEI and EDDI. Utilizing the interpretation from the US Drought\nmonitor, values of these drought indices have the following meaning:\n\nPDSI and z:\n\n  * 5.0 or more (extremely wet)\n  * 4.0 to 4.99 (very wet)\n  * 3.0 to 3.99 (moderately wet),\n  * 2.0 to 2.99 (slightly wet)\n  * 1.0 to 1.99 (incipient wet spell)\n  * -0.99 to 0.99(near normal)\n  * -1.99 to -1.00 (incipient dry spell)\n  * -2.99 to -2.00 (mild drought)\n  * -3.99 to -3.00 (moderate drought)\n  * -4.99 to -4.00 (severe drought)\n  * -5.0 or less (extreme drought)\n\nSPI/SPEI/EDDI:\n\n  * 2.0 or more (extremely wet)\n  * 1.6 to 1.99 (very wet)\n  * 1.3 to 1.59 (moderately wet),\n  * 0.8 to 1.29 (slightly wet)\n  * 0.5 to 0.79 (incipient wet spell)\n  * -0.49 to 0.49(near normal),\n  * -0.79 to -0.5 (incipient dry spell)\n  * -1.29 to -0.8 (mild drought)\n  * -1.59 to -1.3 (moderate drought)\n  * -1.99 to -1.6 (severe drought)\n  * -2.0 or less (extreme drought).\n\nThis dataset contains provisional products that are replaced with\nupdated versions when the complete source data become available.\nProducts can be distinguished by the value of the 'status' property.\nAt first, assets are ingested with status='early'.

It uses climatically aided interpolation,\ncombining high-spatial resolution climatological normals from the\n[WorldClim dataset](http://worldclim.org/version2), with coarser spatial\nresolution, but time-varying data from\n[CRU Ts4.0](http://data.ceda.ac.uk//badc/cru/data/cru_ts/) and the\n[Japanese 55-year Reanalysis (JRA55)](http://jra.kishou.go.jp/JRA-55/index_en.html).\nConceptually, the procedure applies interpolated time-varying anomalies\nfrom CRU Ts4.0/JRA55 to the high-spatial resolution climatology of\nWorldClim to create a high-spatial resolution dataset that covers a broader\ntemporal record.\n\nTemporal information is inherited from CRU Ts4.0 for most global land\nsurfaces for temperature, precipitation, and vapor pressure. However,\nJRA55 data is used for regions where CRU data had zero climate stations\ncontributing (including all of Antarctica, and parts of Africa,\nSouth America, and scattered islands). For primary climate variables of\ntemperature, vapor pressure, and precipitation, the University of Idaho\nprovides additional data on the number of stations (between 0 and 8) that\ncontributed to the CRU Ts4.0 data used by TerraClimate.

TerraClimate will not capture temporal variability at finer scales than\n    parent datasets and thus is not able to capture variability in\n    orographic precipitation ratios and inversions.\n\n 3.

It is the representation of the degree of urbanization\n([DEGURBA](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/degree-of-urbanisation/background))\nconcept into the GHSL data scenario. Each grid in the GHS-SMOD has been\ngenerated by integrating the GHSL built-up areas and GHSL population grids\ndata for reference epochs: 1975, 1990, 2000, 2015.\n\nThe DEGURBA classification schema is a people-based definition of cities and\nsettlements: it operates using as main input a 1 km² grid cell accounting\nfor population at a given point in time. The DEGURBA discriminates the\npopulation grid cells in three main classes: '[urban centers](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_centre)'\n(cities), '[urban clusters](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Urban_cluster)'\n(towns and suburbs), and '[rural grid cells](http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Glossary:Rural_grid_cell)'.\n(base).

In the GHS-SMOD representation, the 'HDC' are the spatial\ngeneralization of contiguous population grid cells (4-connectivity,\ngap-filling) with a density of at least 1500 inhabitants per km² or a\ndensity of built-up surface > 50%, and a minimum total resident population\nof 50000.

After a minimum\namount of hand-editing, the constructed hydrography map shows good agreement with\nexisting quality-controlled river network datasets in terms of flow accumulation\narea and river basin shape (see Figure 9a in the paper). The location of river\nstreamlines was realistically aligned with existing satellite-based global\nriver channel data (see Figure 10a in the paper). Relative error\nin the drainage area was smaller than 0.05 for 90% of GRDC gauges, confirming\nthe accuracy of the delineated global river networks. Discrepancies in flow accumulation\narea were found mostly in arid river basins containing depressions that are occasionally\nconnected at high water levels and thus resulting in uncertain watershed boundaries.\n\nMERIT Hydro improves on existing global hydrography datasets in terms of spatial\ncoverage (between 90N and 60S) and representation of small streams, mainly due\nto increased availability of high-quality baseline geospatial datasets.\n\n[You can use this web app to visualize MERIT Hydro data.](https://meritdataset.users.earthengine.app/view/merit-hydro-visualization-and-interactive-map)\n[The app\\'s source code is available.](https://github.com/google/earthengine-community/blob/master/datasets/scripts/Hydro_Visualization.js)\n\nKnown Problems:\n\n* River width (Update from GWD-LR v1): Width algorithm was updated to consider\n  sub-pixel water fraction. Now, 30 m water map is used for width calculation at\n  90 m resolution. Currently river width is calculated for each channel separately\n  in braided/anabranching sections. Merged river width should be calculated.\n* Water body map: There are some inconsistencies between the DEM land sea mask and\n  wate body data (such as new islands along the coast). The quality of OpenStreeetMap\n  water body layer is not uniform in all areas.\n* Channel bifurcations: Channel bifurcation is not well represented in the current\n  version. Each pixel is assumed to have only one downstream direction. Secondary\n  (or multiple) downstream direction should be considered, to represent complex\n  river networks in the delta regions, floodplains, and braided rivers.\n* Underground rivers/tunnels: Major underground rivers/tunnels should be implemented\n  to improve large-scale water balance.\n* River/lake separation: Rivers and lakes need to be separated better for some applications.\n* Below-sea-level areas: The areas below sea level in coastal regions are not well\n  represented in adjusted elevation data.\n* Flow direction over glaciers: Flow direction over glaciers is not well represented,\n  because the elevation of glacier centerline is higher than glacier edge.\n* Supplementary data: It would be better to add location of GRDC gauging stations, water\n  falls, reservoirs, etc.'\n","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Dai Yamazaki (University of Tokyo)","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro/index.html"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-90,180,90]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["1987-01-01T00:00:00Z","2017-01-01T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/MERIT/Hydro/v1_0_1"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/MERIT_Hydro_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/MERIT_Hydro_v1_0_1#terms-of-use"},{"rel":"license","href":"http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~yamadai/MERIT_Hydro/index.html"}]},{"stac_version":"1.0.0-beta.2","stac_extensions":[],"id":"MODIS/006/MCD12Q1","title":"MCD12Q1.006 MODIS Land Cover Type Yearly Global 500m","description":"The MCD12Q1 V6 product provides global land cover types at yearly intervals\n(2001-2016) derived from six different classification schemes.

The monthly composites are only available as urban\ncluster means.\n\nA summary of older versions,\nincluding changes from the dataset created and analyzed in the originally\npublished manuscript can be found on the\n[Yale Center for Earth Observation website](https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer).\nThe dataset can also be explored using the [Global Surface UHI\nExplorer web application](https://yceo.users.earthengine.app/view/uhimap).\n\nThe dataset is split into the following six components:\n\n1. **UHI_all_averaged:** Image containing cluster-mean\ncomposite daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity for annual, summer,\nand winter.\n\n2. **UHI_monthly_averaged:** Image containing cluster-mean\nmonthly composites of daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity.\n\n3. **UHI_yearly_averaged:** Image collection of cluster-mean\nyearly composites of daytime and nighttime SUHI intensity from 2003.\nto 2018.\n\n4. **UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) annual daytime and nighttime\nSUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n\n5. **Summer_UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) summertime daytime and\nnighttime SUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n\n6. **Winter_UHI_yearly_pixel:** Image collection of spatially\ndisaggregated (nominal scale of 300 m) wintertime daytime and\nnighttime SUHI intensity from 2003 to 2018.\n'\n\n\nThis asset is the sixth component.","license":"proprietary","providers":[{"name":"Yale Center for Earth Observation (YCEO)","roles":["producer","licensor"],"url":"https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer"},{"name":"Google Earth Engine","roles":["host"],"url":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/YALE_YCEO_UHI_Winter_UHI_yearly_pixel_v4"}],"extent":{"spatial":{"bbox":[[-180,-49.98,180,69.7]]},"temporal":{"interval":[["2003-01-01T00:00:00Z","2018-12-31T00:00:00Z"]]}},"links":[{"rel":"self","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections/YALE/YCEO/UHI/Winter_UHI_yearly_pixel/v4"},{"rel":"parent","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/collections"},{"rel":"root","href":"https://earthengine.openeo.org/v1.0/"},{"rel":"preview","href":"https://mw1.google.com/ges/dd/images/YALE_YCEO_UHI_pixel_sample.png"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/YALE_YCEO_UHI_Winter_UHI_yearly_pixel_v4#terms-of-use"},{"rel":"license","href":"https://yceo.yale.edu/research/global-surface-uhi-explorer"}]}]
